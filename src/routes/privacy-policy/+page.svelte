				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DOES VIVIDGEN RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					In Short: VividGen only processes your personal information when we believe it is
					necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable
					law, like with your consent, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our
					contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business
					interests.
				</p>
				<p>This section applies to you if you are in the EU or UK.</p>
				<p>
					The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require VividGen to explain the
					valid legal bases we rely on to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on
					the following legal bases to process your personal information:
				</p>
				<p>Consent.</p>
				<p>
					VividGen may process your information if you have permitted us (i.e., consent) to use your
					personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
				</p>
				<p>Legitimate Interests.</p>
				<p>
					VividGen may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to
					achieve our legitimate business interests. Those interests do not outweigh your interests
					and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information
					for some of the purposes described to:
				</p>
				<p>
					&sect; Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and
					services
				</p>
				<p>
					&sect; Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users
				</p>
				<p>
					&sect; Analyze how our services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users
				</p>
				<p>&sect; Support our marketing activities</p>
				<p>&sect; Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</p>
				<p>Legal Obligations.</p>
				<p>
					VividGen may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with
					our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory
					agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
					litigation in which we are involved.
				</p>
				<p>Vital Interests.</p>
				<p>
					VividGen may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your
					vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as in situations involving
					potential threats to the safety of any person.
				</p>
				<p>
					In legal terms, VividGen is generally the &ldquo;data controller&rdquo; under European
					data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice since we
					determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice
					does not apply to the personal information we process as a &ldquo;data processor&rdquo; on
					behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer with that we provide services
					and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the &ldquo;data
					controller&rdquo; responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your
					information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. To know more about our
					customers' privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any
					questions you have to them.
				</p>
				<p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
				<p>
					VividGen may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.,
					express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose or in situations
					where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your
					consent at any time.
				</p>
				<p>
					In some exceptional cases, VividGen may be legally permitted under applicable law to
					process your information without your consent, including, for example:
				</p>
				<p>
					If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained
					promptly.
				</p>
				<p>For investigations and fraud detection, and prevention.</p>
				<p>For business transactions, provided certain conditions are met.</p>
				<p>
					If it is contained in a witness statement, the collection is necessary to assess, process,
					or settle an insurance claim.
				</p>
				<p>Identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin.</p>
				<p>
					If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or maybe a victim of
					financial abuse.
				</p>
				<p>
					If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the
					availability or the accuracy of the information.
				</p>
				<p><strong>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
				<p>
					In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or
					with the following third parties.
				</p>
				<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
				<p>Business Transfers.</p>
				<p>
					We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of,
					any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of
					VividGen's business to another company.
				</p>
				<p><strong>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong></p>
				<p>
					In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your
					information.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to
					access or store information. Our Cookie Notice sets out specific information about how we
					use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies.
				</p>
				<p><strong>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
				<p>
					In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
					outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
					purposes set out in this privacy notice unless a longer retention period is required or
					permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in
					this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than one (1)
					year.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
					will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for
					example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
					will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
					until deletion is possible.
				</p>
				<p><strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
				<p>
					In Short: At VividGen, we prioritize the protection of your personal information through
					the use of both technical and organizational security measures.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have implemented reasonable and appropriate security measures to ensure the safety of
					any personal information processed through our AI art generator. While we strive to
					maintain the security of your information, it's important to note that no electronic
					transmission or storage technology can guarantee complete security. This means that
					unauthorized parties, such as cybercriminals or hackers, may be able to access, steal,
					modify, or collect your personal information. Therefore, it's important to use our
					Services within a secure environment and understand that any transmission of personal
					information is done at your own risk.
				</p>
				<p><strong>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
				<p>
					In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK),
					and Canada, you have certain rights regarding your personal information. You may access,
					modify, or terminate your account at any time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Depending on your location and the applicable data protection laws, you have the right to
					request access to and receive a copy of your personal information, request correction or
					deletion of your personal information, request restrictions on the processing of your
					personal information, and, in certain circumstances, request the portability of your
					personal information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
					information. If you believe that VividGen is unlawfully processing your personal
					information, you have the right to file a complaint with your local data protection
					supervisory authority.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to
					withdraw your consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
					done prior to the withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal
					information that was conducted through lawful processing grounds other than consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional communications by unsubscribing
					through the link in our emails or contacting us. Note that you may still receive
					non-marketing messages necessary for the administration and use of your account or in
					response to service requests.
				</p>
				<p>
					We use cookies and similar technologies on our Services, but you can usually set your web
					browser to remove and reject cookies. However, this may affect certain features or
					services of our Services.
				</p>
				<p><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
				<p>
					Most web browsers, mobile operating systems, and mobile applications include a
					Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
					and not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No
					uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been
					finalised at this stage. As such, VividGen, our AI art generator, does not currently
					respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
					choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
					follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
					privacy notice.
				</p>
				<p><strong>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
				<p>
					In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights
					regarding access to your personal information.
				</p>
				<p>
					California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits
					our users who are California residents to request and obtain from VividGen, our AI art
					generator, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal
					information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the
					names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the
					immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to
					make such a request, please submit your request in writing using the contact information
					provided below.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with
					VividGen, our AI art generator, you have the right to request the removal of unwanted data
					that you publicly post on the Services. To request the removal of such data, please get in
					touch with us using the contact information provided below. Include the email address
					associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will ensure
					the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may
					not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).
				</p>
				<p><strong>CCPA Privacy Notice</strong></p>
				<p>The California Code of Regulations defines a "resident" as:</p>
				<p>
					(1) every individual who is in the State of California for other than a temporary or
					transitory purpose and
				</p>
				<p>
					(2) every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is outside the State
					of California for a temporary or transitory purpose
				</p>
				<p>All other individuals are defined as "non-residents.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>
					If this definition of "resident" applies to you, VividGen, our AI art generator, must
					adhere to certain rights and obligations regarding your personal information.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may also collect other personal information outside of these categories in instances
					where you interact with us in person, online, or by phone or mail in the context of:
				</p>
				<p>Receiving help through our customer support channels;</p>
				<p>Participation in customer surveys or contests; and</p>
				<p>Facilitate the delivery of our Services and respond to your inquiries.</p>
				<p><strong>How do we use and share your personal information?</strong></p>
				<p>
					This privacy notice can find more information about our data collection and sharing
					practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may contact us by email at <a
						href="mailto:info@vividgen.com"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener">info@vividgen.com</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are using an authorised agent to exercise your right to opt-out, we may deny a
					request if the authorised agent does not submit proof that they have been validly
					authorised to act on your behalf.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</strong></p>
				<p>
					VividGen may disclose your personal information with our service providers according to a
					written contract between each service provider and us. Each service provider is a
					for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.
				</p>
				<p>
					VividGen may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for
					undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not
					considered the "selling" of your personal information.
				</p>
				<p>
					VividGen has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a
					business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. VividGen will not sell
					personal information to website visitors, users, and other consumers in the future.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Your rights concerning your personal data</strong></p>
				<p>Right to request deletion of the data &mdash; Request to delete</p>
				<p>
					You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your
					personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information,
					subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise
					by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements
					resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect
					against illegal activities.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Right to be informed &mdash; Request to know:</strong></p>
				<p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>
				<p>whether VividGen collects and uses your personal information;</p>
				<p>the categories of personal information that VividGen collects;</p>
				<p>the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;</p>
				<p>whether VividGen sells your personal information to third parties;</p>
				<p>
					the categories of personal information that VividGen sold or disclosed for a business
					purpose;
				</p>
				<p>
					the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for
					a business purpose; and
				</p>
				<p>the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.</p>
				<p>
					In accordance with applicable law, VividGen is not obligated to provide or delete consumer
					information de-identified in response to a consumer request or re-identify individual data
					to verify a consumer request.
				</p>
				<p>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer&rsquo;s Privacy Rights</p>
				<p>VividGen will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>
				<p><strong>Verification Process</strong></p>
				<p>
					Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine whether you
					are the same person with whom we have the information in our system. These verification
					efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with the
					information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
					request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
					information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact
					you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously
					provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will only use the personal information provided in your request to verify your identity
					or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting
					additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
					verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that
					you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
					security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additional information as soon
					as we finish verifying you.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Other Privacy Rights</strong></p>
				<p>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</p>
				<p>
					You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant
					or ask to restrict the processing of the information.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can designate an authorized agent to request the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a
					request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly
					authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third
					parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as
					feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request
					submission.
				</p>
				<p>
					To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at info@vividgen.ai or by referring

					laws.
